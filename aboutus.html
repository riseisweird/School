                    <h1 class="left">History</h1>
                    <p>Delhi Public School Ghaziabad was conceived and founded by Mr. Om Pathak, the then District
                      Magistrate of Ghaziabad in 1980 with support from Sh. Dharamvira and Lt. Colonel Dr. GPS Waraich,
                      the then Principal of DPS, Mathura Road.</p>
                    <img src="https://www.dpsgs.org/dpsg-cms/imagedir/DPSGM/History/Untitled.jpg" class="responsive">
                    <p>The school commenced operations in a hired building in Raj Nagar on the 5th September, 1980. The
                      foundation stone of the new building was laid by Sh. Dharamvira, on the 19th of April, 1981 and
                      soon thereafter, the school shifted to its present locale. The school has made steady progress
                      over the past 41 years. Since its affiliation to the CBSE in 1985, 31 batches of class XII have
                      passed through the portals of the school.</p>

                    <h1 class="left">A Brief Discriptor Of School</h1>
                    <p>Delhi Public School Ghaziabad, a premier English medium co-educational institution of Western
                      Uttar Pradesh is situated on the Delhi-Meerut Highway. A sprawling lush green locale of 15 acres
                      of this 41 year old school provides an environment that is conducive to meet the intellectual
                      pursuits and holistic development of nearly 6000 students who come here to study, to build, to
                      dream, to find their bearing and to blossom into balanced and responsible citizens of whom any
                      country would feel proud. It is a path breaker in pursuit of excellence. DPSG is the ﬁrst school
                      in NCR to get ISO 9001:2008 certiﬁcation by the International body Det Norske Veritas. The school
                      today is recognized as an institution par excellence for imparting quality education with due
                      emphasis on extracurricular activities.

                    <p>The majestic red brick building with its large playing fields have been the training grounds
                      where generations of youngsters have learned, played, cheered, won and lost many a game</p>
                    <img src="https://www.dpsgs.org/dpsg-cms/imagedir/DPSGM/History/IMG_2081.JPG" class="responsive">
                    <p>The school provides state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities to the students like
                      basketball courts and playgrounds that meet international standards. Our school has hosted and our
                      students have enthusiastically participated in all sports events like Clusters as well as other
                      skating and shooting competitions held by CBSE.</p>
                    <img src="https://www.dpsgs.org/dpsg-cms/imagedir/DPSGM/History/DSC08110.JPG" class="responsive">
                    <p>The school has huge fully air-conditioned auditoriums equipped with all facilities for dance,
                      theater and other literary functions. It also has a Stadia & Amphitheater for conducting
                      assemblies, functions etc.</p>

                    <p>The school is divided into four separate wings which function efficiently and competently under
                      the able leadership of four Head Mistresses. The teaching and the non- teaching staff allocated to
                      each wing report directly to their respective Heads. This clear distribution of authority and
                      responsibility not only gives structure to the school's functionality but also gives it an impetus
                      to run smoothly.</p>
                    <p>DPSG is amongst ﬁrst in bringing International education to Ghaziabad. The school has been
                      authorized by International Baccalaureate at Geneva, Switzerland to offer Primary Years Programme
                      [PYP], a futuristic and international programme for classes 1 to 5 students. DPSG has also
                      introduced International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme [DP] for classes XI & XII, which prepare
                      students for international education in the best higher educational institutions.</p>
